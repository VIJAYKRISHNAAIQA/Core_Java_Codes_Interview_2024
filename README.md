🎥 Core Java Concepts

📖 Basics of Java

Definition: Java is an object-oriented, platform-independent programming language used to build robust and secure applications.

Analogy: Think of Java as a universal remote control. Just as one remote can operate various devices, Java's platform independence allows it to run on different operating systems without modification.

Key Topics:

Data Types

Variables

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)

Example:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

📖 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Definition: OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods.

Key Topics:

Classes and Objects

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

Encapsulation

Real-World Example:
A Car object has properties (color, model) and behaviors (start, stop).

Program:

class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stopped");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.color = "Red";
        car.model = "Sedan";
        car.start();
    }
}

📖 Collections Framework

Definition: A framework that provides architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects.

Key Topics:

List, Set, Map

ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet

Analogy: Collections are like containers in a warehouse where items are stored, categorized, and retrieved efficiently.

Example:

import java.util.ArrayList;
public class CollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

📖 Exception Handling

Definition: Mechanism to handle runtime errors.

Key Concepts:

try, catch, finally

throw and throws

Example:

public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
    }
}

📖 Multithreading

Definition: The ability to execute multiple threads simultaneously.

Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}

public class MultithreadingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}

📖 File Handling

Definition: Reading from and writing to files.

Example:

import java.io.*;
public class FileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            writer.write("Hello, File Handling!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

📖 Java 8 Features

Key Topics:

Streams

Lambda Expressions

Functional Interfaces

Example:

import java.util.*;
public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

🔍 Real-Time Examples and Analogies

Inheritance: Like children inheriting traits from their parents.

Polymorphism: A person can be a parent, employee, and friend at the same time.

Collections: A supermarket shopping cart holding various items.

📑 Cheat Sheet for Coding Interviews

Commonly Asked Questions:

Reverse a string.

Find the largest number in an array.

Check for a palindrome.

Implement a singleton class.

Tips:

Write clean and modular code.

Understand the problem statement clearly.

Optimize for time and space complexity.

Quick Snippet:

Palindrome Check:

public class Palindrome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "madam";
        System.out.println(new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString().equals(str));
    }
}
